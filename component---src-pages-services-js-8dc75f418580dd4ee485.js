After you are cleared to participate in KAP you will then have preparation sessions to prepare you for the ketamine experience.

After you have completed your ketamine session you will have integration sessions, which will help you apply the insights you learned into new patterns of thinking and behaving that increase your overall wellness.

The PSIP model is focused on working directly with the nervous system to treat trauma and mental health symptoms. You will first complete a psychological intake session to determine whether PSIP treatment is safe for you. After the intake session, there will then be 1 or more preparatory sessions depending on different factors to help you be most prepared for your PSIP session. You will first do a non-medicine PSIP session to get familiar with the approach and learn to trust your body without the medicine on board. You will then engage in medicine-assisted PSIP sessions to allow your autonomic nervous system to naturally process charged trauma memories in a safe and supportive setting. Integration sessions will then follow the medicine sessions to become aware of and notice different shifts in your mind and body that resulted from the medicine sessions. The amount of PSIP sessions depends on each individual person and how they responded to previous sessions.",i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),"To gain an understanding of the PSIP model to see if you are interested in participating in this treatment go to the Psychedelic Somatic Instituteâ€™s website for more information",i.a.createElement("a",{style:y,href:"https://www.psychedelicsomatic.org/"}," https://www.psychedelicsomatic.org/ ")),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("h3",{id:"individual-kap",style:p},"Psychedelic Integration - "),i.a.createElement("h5",{style:m},"Psychedelic Integration is designed to support people who want to increase the benefits of their psychedelic experience by processing, exploring, and implementing insights and challenges that were discovered during their psychedelic journey.
