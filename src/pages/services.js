                     The process of KAP treatment will start with a medical and psychological intake to make sure that ketamine-assisted psychotherapy is safe for you. After you are cleared to participate in KAP you will then have preparation sessions to prepare you for the ketamine experience. You will set intentions for your experience, learn how to navigate the ketamine space, and learn how to get the most benefit out of your ketamine session. After you have completed your ketamine session you will have integration sessions, which will help you apply the insights you learned into new patterns of thinking and behaving that increase your overall wellness. Every patient will have an individualized treatment plan that is customized and specific to their unique needs and goals. For more information on KAP check out the Resources or FAQ tabs.

                           Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy is a different approach than the traditional non-directive psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy process. The PSIP model is focused on working directly with the nervous system to treat trauma and mental health symptoms. You will first complete a psychological intake session to determine whether PSIP treatment is safe for you. After the intake session, there will then be 1 or more preparatory sessions depending on different factors to help you be most prepared for your PSIP session. You will first do a non-medicine PSIP session to get familiar with the approach and learn to trust your body without the medicine on board. You will then engage in medicine-assisted PSIP sessions to allow your autonomic nervous system to naturally process charged trauma memories in a safe and supportive setting. Integration sessions will then follow the medicine sessions to become aware of and notice different shifts in your mind and body that resulted from the medicine sessions. The amount of PSIP sessions depends on each individual person and how they responded to previous sessions.

                  <h5 style={ApproachDescriptionTextStyles}>
                     Psychedelic Integration is designed to support people who want to increase the benefits of their psychedelic experience by processing, exploring, and implementing insights and challenges that were discovered during their psychedelic journey. The integration process is a major part of what leads to personal transformation and new ways of thinking, behaving, and relating to others. We will create a unique and individualized integration plan for you that will help you gain long term benefits from your psychedelic experience. Increasing education and safety around psychedelics is a key component of the integration process. I take a harm-reduction approach to psychedelic integration and do not supply people with psychedelics. Please do not ask where to find psychedelic substances.

                           Using cognitive-behavior therapy you will learn to increase your awareness and attention to patterns of thinking and behaving that are causing you problems in your life. By developing helpful skills to change your thinking and behaviors you can learn to have a more relaxed, creative, and flexible mind. Different skills that can be learned are progressive muscle relaxation, cognitive reframing, social skills, problem solving skills, and mindfulness based exercises to become more present in the moment and quiet down your anxious thoughts.
